## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned


```css
.hero_img {
  //used it to handle the image being full view height 💪🏽
  background-image: url("../images/hero-desktop.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  position: absolute;
  margin: 0;
  inset: 0 0 0 auto;
  height: 100vh;
  width: 40%;
}
```


### Continued development


 - Image Handling - Not sure to add them using css or html for the ones that change on responsiveness
 - Using the picture property in html ... seen that it handles @media well so will dive into that a bit later on
 - Javascript - Had to steal or rather borrow a whole code from @Ali in the acknowledgment section jus to handle a simple thing 😓


### Useful resources


- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - Helped me get a better understanding of how background positions work -- my guy on all things alien 💯.
